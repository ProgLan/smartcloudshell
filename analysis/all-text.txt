Add a job to a Batch account.
The maximum elapsed time that the job may run, measured from the time the job is created. If the job does not complete within the time limit, the Batch service terminates it and any tasks that are still running. In this case, the termination reason will be MaxWallClockTimeExpiry. If this property is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the job may run. Expected format is an ISO-8601 duration.
The command line of the Job Manager task. The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path (relative to the task working directory), or use the Batch provided environment variable (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
A string that uniquely identifies the job within the account. The ID can contain any combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores, and cannot contain more than 64 characters. The ID is case-preserving and case-insensitive (that is, you may not have two IDs within an account that differ only by case).
The priority of the job. Priority values can range from -1000 to 1000, with -1000 being the lowest priority and 1000 being the highest priority. The default value is 0.
Batch account name. Alternatively, set by environment variable: AZURE_BATCH_ACCOUNT
A string that uniquely identifies the Job Manager task within the job. The ID can contain any combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot contain more than 64 characters.
A list of files that the Batch service will download to the compute node before running the command line. Files listed under this element are located in the task's working directory. Space-separated resource references in filename=blobsource format.
A file containing the job specification in JSON format. If this parameter is specified, all 'Job Arguments' are ignored.
The maximum number of times each task may be retried. The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try each task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries a task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry tasks. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries tasks without limit. The default value is 0 (no retries).
A list of environment variable settings for the Job Manager task. Space-separated values in 'key=value' format.
A list of name-value pairs associated with the job as metadata. The Batch service does not assign any meaning to metadata; it is solely for the use of user code. Space-separated values in 'key=value' format.
Batch service endpoint. Alternatively, set by environment variable: AZURE_BATCH_ENDPOINT
Whether tasks in the job can define dependencies on each other. The default is false. True if flag present.
The id of an existing pool. All the tasks of the job will run on the specified pool.

If the current value is terminatejob, this is an error because a job's completion behavior may not be changed from terminatejob to noaction. You may not change the value from terminatejob to noaction - that is, once you have engaged automatic job termination, you cannot turn it off again. If you try to do this, the request fails and Batch returns status code 400 (Bad Request) and an 'invalid property value' error response. If you do not specify this element in a PUT request, it is equivalent to passing noaction. This is an error if the current value is terminatejob.
Batch account name. Alternatively, set by environment variable: AZURE_BATCH_ACCOUNT
The priority of the job. Priority values can range from -1000 to 1000, with -1000 being the lowest priority and 1000 being the highest priority. If omitted, it is set to the default value 0.

A file containing the job update parameter specification in JSON format. If this parameter is specified, all 'Job Arguments' are ignored.
The maximum number of times each task may be retried. The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try each task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries a task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry tasks. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries tasks without limit. The default value is 0 (no retries).
A list of name-value pairs associated with the job as metadata. If omitted, it takes the default value of an empty list; in effect, any existing metadata is deleted. Space-separated values in 'key=value' format.

Copies a blob asynchronously. This operation returns a copy operation  properties object, including a copy ID you can use to check or abort the  copy operation. The Blob service copies blobs on a best-effort basis.  The source blob for a copy operation may be a block blob, an append blob,  or a page blob. If the destination blob already exists, it must be of the  same blob type as the source blob. Any existing destination blob will be  overwritten. The destination blob cannot be modified while a copy operation  is in progress.  When copying from a page blob, the Blob service creates a destination page  blob of the source blob's length, initially containing all zeroes. Then  the source page ranges are enumerated, and non-empty ranges are copied.   For a block blob or an append blob, the Blob service creates a committed  blob of zero length before returning from this operation. When copying  from a block blob, all committed blocks and their block IDs are copied.  Uncommitted blocks are not copied. At the end of the copy operation, the  destination blob will have the same committed block count as the source.  When copying from an append blob, all committed blocks are copied. At the  end of the copy operation, the destination blob will have the same committed  block count as the source.  For all blob types, you can call get_blob_properties on the destination  blob to check the status of the copy operation. The final blob will be  committed when the copy completes.
 The lease ID specified for this header must match the lease ID of the destination blob. If the request does not include the lease ID or it is not valid, the operation fails with status code 412 (Precondition Failed).
A Shared Access Signature (SAS). Must be used in conjunction with storage account name. Environment variable: AZURE_STORAGE_SAS_TOKEN
 A DateTime value. Azure expects the date value passed in to be UTC. If timezone is included, any non-UTC datetimes will be converted to UTC. If a date is passed in without timezone info, it is assumed to be UTC. Specify this conditional header to copy the blob only if the destination blob has not been modified since the specified date/time. If the destination blob has been modified, the Blob service returns status code 412 (Precondition Failed).
 A URL of up to 2 KB in length that specifies an Azure file or blob. The value should be URL-encoded as it would appear in a request URI. If the source is in another account, the source must either be public or must be authenticated via a shared access signature. If the source is public, no authentication is required. Examples: https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myblob https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myblob?snapshot=<DateTime> https://otheraccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myblob?sastoken
 An ETag value, or the wildcard character (*). Specify an ETag value for this conditional header to copy the blob only if the specified ETag value does not match the ETag value for the destination blob. Specify the wildcard character (*) to perform the operation only if the destination blob does not exist. If the specified condition isn't met, the Blob service returns status code 412 (Precondition Failed).
The share name for the source storage account.
 An ETag value, or the wildcard character (*). Specify an ETag value for this conditional header to copy the blob only if the specified ETag value matches the ETag value for an existing destination blob.

Retrieves statistics related to replication for the Queue service. It is  only available when read-access geo-redundant replication is enabled for  the storage account.  With geo-redundant replication, Azure Storage maintains your data durable  in two locations. In both locations, Azure Storage constantly maintains  multiple healthy replicas of your data. The location where you read,  create, update, or delete data is the primary storage account location.  The primary location exists in the region you choose at the time you  create an account via the Azure Management Azure classic portal, for  example, North Central US. The location to which your data is replicated  is the secondary location. The secondary location is automatically  determined based on the location of the primary; it is in a second data  center that resides in the same region as the primary location. Read-only  access is available from the secondary location, if read-access geo-redundant  replication is enabled for your storage account.

Enables automatic scaling for a pool.  You cannot enable automatic scaling on a pool if a resize operation is in progress on the pool. If automatic scaling of the pool is currently disabled, you must specify a valid autoscale formula as part of the request. If automatic scaling of the pool is already enabled, you may specify a new autoscale formula and/or a new evaluation interval. You cannot call this API for the same pool more than once every 30 seconds.
A timestamp indicating the last modified time of the resource known to the client. The operation will be performed only if the resource on the service has not been modified since the specified time.
The time interval at which to automatically adjust the pool size according to the autoscale formula. The default value is 15 minutes. The minimum and maximum value are 5 minutes and 168 hours respectively. If you specify a value less than 5 minutes or greater than 168 hours, the Batch service rejects the request with an invalid property value error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request). If you specify a new interval, then the existing autoscale evaluation schedule will be stopped and a new autoscale evaluation schedule will be started, with its starting time being the time when this request was issued.

Update the properties of a job schedule.
The time interval between the start times of two successive jobs under the job schedule. A job schedule can have at most one active job under it at any given time. Because a job schedule can have at most one active job under it at any given time, if it is time to create a new job under a job schedule, but the previous job is still running, the Batch service will not create the new job until the previous job finishes. If the previous job does not finish within the startWindow period of the new recurrenceInterval, then no new job will be scheduled for that interval. For recurring jobs, you should normally specify a jobManagerTask in the jobSpecification. If you do not use jobManagerTask, you will need an external process to monitor when jobs are created, add tasks to the jobs and terminate the jobs ready for the next recurrence. The default is that the schedule does not recur: one job is created, within the startWindow after the doNotRunUntil time, and the schedule is complete as soon as that job finishes. The minimum value is 1 minute. If you specify a lower value, the Batch service rejects the schedule with an error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request). Expected format is an ISO-8601 duration.
A string that uniquely identifies the Job Manager task within the job. The ID can contain any combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot contain more than 64 characters.
A list of files that the Batch service will download to the compute node before running the command line. Files listed under this element are located in the task's working directory. Space-separated resource references in filename=blobsource format.
A list of environment variable settings for the Job Manager task. Space-separated values in 'key=value' format.
Batch service endpoint. Alternatively, set by environment variable: AZURE_BATCH_ENDPOINT
A timestamp indicating the last modified time of the resource known to the client. The operation will be performed only if the resource on the service has not been modified since the specified time.
The priority of jobs created under this schedule. Priority values can range from -1000 to 1000, with -1000 being the lowest priority and 1000 being the highest priority. The default value is 0. This priority is used as the default for all jobs under the job schedule. You can update a job's priority after it has been created using by using the update job API.
A file containing the job schedule patch parameter specification in JSON format. If this parameter is specified, all 'Job Schedule Arguments' are ignored.
A list of name-value pairs associated with the job schedule as metadata. If you do not specify this element, existing metadata is left unchanged. Space-separated values in 'key=value' format.
An ETag value associated with the version of the resource known to the client. The operation will be performed only if the resource's current ETag on the service exactly matches the value specified by the client.
The command line of the Job Manager task. The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path (relative to the task working directory), or use the Batch provided environment variable (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
A list of name-value pairs associated with each job created under this schedule as metadata. The Batch service does not assign any meaning to metadata; it is solely for the use of user code. Space-separated values in 'key=value' format.
The action the Batch service should take when all tasks in a job created under this schedule are in the completed state. Note that if a job contains no tasks, then all tasks are considered complete. This option is therefore most commonly used with a Job Manager task; if you want to use automatic job termination without a Job Manager, you should initially set onAllTasksComplete to noaction and update the job properties to set onAllTasksComplete to terminatejob once you have finished adding tasks. The default is noaction.
Batch account name. Alternatively, set by environment variable: AZURE_BATCH_ACCOUNT
Batch account key. Alternatively, set by environment variable: AZURE_BATCH_ACCESS_KEY
An ETag value associated with the version of the resource known to the client. The operation will be performed only if the resource's current ETag on the service does not match the value specified by the client.
The ID of the job schedule to update.
A list of application packages that the Batch service will deploy to the compute node before running the command line. Application packages are downloaded and deployed to a shared directory, not the task working directory. Therefore, if a referenced package is already on the compute node, and is up to date, then it is not re-downloaded; the existing copy on the compute node is used. If a referenced application package cannot be installed, for example because the package has been deleted or because download failed, the task fails. Space-separated application IDs with optional version in 'id[#version]' format.
A timestamp indicating the last modified time of the resource known to the client. The operation will be performed only if the resource on the service has been modified since the specified time.
Whether tasks in the job can define dependencies on each other. The default is false. Specify either 'true' or 'false' to update the property.
The earliest time at which any job may be created under this job schedule. If you do not specify a doNotRunUntil time, the schedule becomes ready to create jobs immediately. Expected format is an ISO-8601 timestamp.
The id of an existing pool. All the tasks of the job will run on the specified pool.
The time interval, starting from the time at which the schedule indicates a job should be created, within which a job must be created. If a job is not created within the startWindow interval, then the 'opportunity' is lost; no job will be created until the next recurrence of the schedule. If the schedule is recurring, and the startWindow is longer than the recurrence interval, then this is equivalent to an infinite startWindow, because the job that is 'due' in one recurrenceInterval is not carried forward into the next recurrence interval. The default is infinite. The minimum value is 1 minute. If you specify a lower value, the Batch service rejects the schedule with an error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request). Expected format is an ISO-8601 duration.
A time after which no job will be created under this job schedule. The schedule will move to the completed state as soon as this deadline is past and there is no active job under this job schedule. If you do not specify a doNotRunAfter time, and you are creating a recurring job schedule, the job schedule will remain active until you explicitly terminate it. Expected format is an ISO-8601 timestamp.

Upgrades the operating system of the specified pool.  During an upgrade, the Batch service upgrades each compute node in the pool. When a compute node is chosen for upgrade, any tasks running on that node are removed from the node and returned to the queue to be rerun later (or on a different compute node). The node will be unavailable until the upgrade is complete. This operation results in temporarily reduced pool capacity as nodes are taken out of service to be upgraded. Although the Batch service tries to avoid upgrading all compute nodes at the same time, it does not guarantee to do this (particularly on small pools); therefore, the pool may be temporarily unavailable to run tasks. When this operation runs, the pool state changes to upgrading. When all compute nodes have finished upgrading, the pool state returns to active. While the upgrade is in progress, the pool's currentOSVersion reflects the OS version that nodes are upgrading from, and targetOSVersion reflects the OS version that nodes are upgrading to. Once the upgrade is complete, currentOSVersion is updated to reflect the OS version now running on all nodes. This operation can only be invoked on pools created with the cloudServiceConfiguration property.

Add a Batch job schedule to an account.
The maximum elapsed time that the job may run, measured from the time the job is created. If the job does not complete within the time limit, the Batch service terminates it and any tasks that are still running. In this case, the termination reason will be MaxWallClockTimeExpiry. If this property is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the job may run. Expected format is an ISO-8601 duration.
A string that uniquely identifies the Job Manager task within the job. The ID can contain any combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot contain more than 64 characters.
The time interval between the start times of two successive jobs under the job schedule. A job schedule can have at most one active job under it at any given time. Because a job schedule can have at most one active job under it at any given time, if it is time to create a new job under a job schedule, but the previous job is still running, the Batch service will not create the new job until the previous job finishes. If the previous job does not finish within the startWindow period of the new recurrenceInterval, then no new job will be scheduled for that interval. For recurring jobs, you should normally specify a jobManagerTask in the jobSpecification. If you do not use jobManagerTask, you will need an external process to monitor when jobs are created, add tasks to the jobs and terminate the jobs ready for the next recurrence. The default is that the schedule does not recur: one job is created, within the startWindow after the doNotRunUntil time, and the schedule is complete as soon as that job finishes. The minimum value is 1 minute. If you specify a lower value, the Batch service rejects the schedule with an error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request). Expected format is an ISO-8601 duration.
A string that uniquely identifies the schedule within the account. The ID can contain any combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores, and cannot contain more than 64 characters. The ID is case-preserving and case-insensitive (that is, you may not have two IDs within an account that differ only by case).
The action the Batch service should take when all tasks in a job created under this schedule are in the completed state. Note that if a job contains no tasks, then all tasks are considered complete. This option is therefore most commonly used with a Job Manager task; if you want to use automatic job termination without a Job Manager, you should initially set onAllTasksComplete to noaction and update the job properties to set onAllTasksComplete to terminatejob once you have finished adding tasks. The default is noaction.
Batch account name. Alternatively, set by environment variable: AZURE_BATCH_ACCOUNT
The priority of jobs created under this schedule. Priority values can range from -1000 to 1000, with -1000 being the lowest priority and 1000 being the highest priority. The default value is 0. This priority is used as the default for all jobs under the job schedule. You can update a job's priority after it has been created using by using the update job API.
A list of files that the Batch service will download to the compute node before running the command line. Files listed under this element are located in the task's working directory. Space-separated resource references in filename=blobsource format.
A file containing the cloud job schedule specification in JSON format. If this parameter is specified, all 'Cloud Job Schedule Arguments' are ignored.
The maximum number of times each task may be retried. The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try each task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries a task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry tasks. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries tasks without limit. The default value is 0 (no retries).
The command line of the Job Manager task. The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path (relative to the task working directory), or use the Batch provided environment variable (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
A list of name-value pairs associated with the schedule as metadata. The Batch service does not assign any meaning to metadata; it is solely for the use of user code. Space-separated values in 'key=value' format.
Batch service endpoint. Alternatively, set by environment variable: AZURE_BATCH_ENDPOINT
Whether tasks in the job can define dependencies on each other. The default is false. True if flag present.
The earliest time at which any job may be created under this job schedule. If you do not specify a doNotRunUntil time, the schedule becomes ready to create jobs immediately. Expected format is an ISO-8601 timestamp.
The id of an existing pool. All the tasks of the job will run on the specified pool.
Batch account key. Alternatively, set by environment variable: AZURE_BATCH_ACCESS_KEY
The time interval, starting from the time at which the schedule indicates a job should be created, within which a job must be created. If a job is not created within the startWindow interval, then the 'opportunity' is lost; no job will be created until the next recurrence of the schedule. If the schedule is recurring, and the startWindow is longer than the recurrence interval, then this is equivalent to an infinite startWindow, because the job that is 'due' in one recurrenceInterval is not carried forward into the next recurrence interval. The default is infinite. The minimum value is 1 minute. If you specify a lower value, the Batch service rejects the schedule with an error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request). Expected format is an ISO-8601 duration.
A time after which no job will be created under this job schedule. The schedule will move to the completed state as soon as this deadline is past and there is no active job under this job schedule. If you do not specify a doNotRunAfter time, and you are creating a recurring job schedule, the job schedule will remain active until you explicitly terminate it. Expected format is an ISO-8601 timestamp.

Upload Azure Batch service log files from the specified compute node to Azure Blob Storage.  This is for gathering Azure Batch service log files in an automated fashion from nodes if you are experiencing an error and wish to escalate to Azure support. The Azure Batch service log files should be shared with Azure support to aid in debugging issues with the Batch service.
The end of the time range from which to upload Batch Service log file(s). Any log file containing a log message in the time range will be uploaded. This means that the operation might retrieve more logs than have been requested since the entire log file is always uploaded, but the operation should not retrieve fewer logs than have been requested. If omitted, the default is to upload all logs available after the startTime. Expected format is an ISO-8601 timestamp.
The URL of the container within Azure Blob Storage to which to upload the Batch Service log file(s). The URL must include a Shared Access Signature (SAS) granting write permissions to the container. The SAS duration must allow enough time for the upload to finish. The start time for SAS is optional and recommended to not be specified.
Batch account name. Alternatively, set by environment variable: AZURE_BATCH_ACCOUNT
The start of the time range from which to upload Batch Service log file(s). Any log file containing a log message in the time range will be uploaded. This means that the operation might retrieve more logs than have been requested since the entire log file is always uploaded, but the operation should not retrieve fewer logs than have been requested. Expected format is an ISO-8601 timestamp.

Create Batch tasks.
The space-separated list of IDs specifying the application packages to be installed. Space-separated application IDs with optional version in 'id[#version]' format.
The maximum elapsed time that the task may run, measured from the time the task starts. If the task does not complete within the time limit, the Batch service terminates it. If this is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may run.
The ID of the task.
The Batch account name. Alternatively, set by environment variable: AZURE_BATCH_ACCOUNT
A list of environment variable settings for the task. Space-separated values in 'key=value' format.
The maximum number of times the task may be retried. The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries for the task executable due to a nonzero exit code. The Batch service will try the task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the task after the first attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the task without limit. Resource files and application packages are only downloaded again if the task is retried on a new compute node.
The file containing the task(s) to create in JSON format, if this parameter is specified, all other parameters are ignored.
A list of files that the Batch service will download to the compute node before running the command line. Space-separated resource references in filename=blobsource format.
Batch service endpoint. Alternatively, set by environment variable: AZURE_BATCH_ENDPOINT
The minimum time to retain the task directory on the compute node where it ran, from the time it completes execution. After this time, the Batch service may delete the task directory and all its contents. The default is infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the compute node is removed or reimaged.
An opaque string representing the location of a compute node or a task that has run previously. You can pass the affinityId of a compute node to indicate that this task needs to run on that compute node. Note that this is just a soft affinity. If the target node is busy or unavailable at the time the task is scheduled, then the task will be scheduled elsewhere.
The command line of the task. The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux.
The ID of the job containing the task.
The Batch account key. Alternatively, set by environment variable: AZURE_BATCH_ACCESS_KEY

Requests that a backup of the specified key be downloaded to the client.  The Key Backup operation exports a key from Azure Key Vault in a protected form. Note that this operation does NOT return key material in a form that can be used outside the Azure Key Vault system, the returned key material is either protected to a Azure Key Vault HSM or to Azure Key Vault itself. The intent of this operation is to allow a client to GENERATE a key in one Azure Key Vault instance, BACKUP the key, and then RESTORE it into another Azure Key Vault instance. The BACKUP operation may be used to export, in protected form, any key type from Azure Key Vault. Individual versions of a key cannot be backed up. BACKUP / RESTORE can be performed within geographical boundaries only; meaning that a BACKUP from one geographical area cannot be restored to another geographical area. For example, a backup from the US geographical area cannot be restored in an EU geographical area.

Update the properties of a Batch pool. Updating a property in a subgroup will reset the unspecified properties of that group.
A list of application packages to be installed on each compute node in the pool. Changes to application package references affect all new compute nodes joining the pool, but do not affect compute nodes that are already in the pool until they are rebooted or reimaged. If this element is present, it replaces any existing application package references. If you specify an empty collection, then all application package references are removed from the pool. If omitted, any existing application package references are left unchanged. Space-separated application IDs with optional version in 'id[#version]' format.
The maximum number of times the task may be retried. The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try the task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the task without limit.

A file containing the pool patch parameter specification in JSON format. If this parameter is specified, all 'Pool Arguments' are ignored.
A list of name-value pairs associated with the pool as metadata. If this element is present, it replaces any existing metadata configured on the pool. If you specify an empty collection, any metadata is removed from the pool. If omitted, any existing metadata is left unchanged. Space-separated values in 'key=value' format.
Batch service endpoint. Alternatively, set by environment variable: AZURE_BATCH_ENDPOINT
A list of environment variable settings for the start task. Space-separated values in 'key=value' format.
The command line of the start task. The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path (relative to the task working directory), or use the Batch provided environment variable (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
The ID of the pool to update.
Batch account key. Alternatively, set by environment variable: AZURE_BATCH_ACCESS_KEY
A list of certificates to be installed on each compute node in the pool. If this element is present, it replaces any existing certificate references configured on the pool. If omitted, any existing certificate references are left unchanged. For Windows compute nodes, the Batch service installs the certificates to the specified certificate store and location. For Linux compute nodes, the certificates are stored in a directory inside the task working directory and an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to query for this location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs' directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g., /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed in that directory. Space-separated certificate thumbprints.
Whether the Batch service should wait for the start task to complete successfully (that is, to exit with exit code 0) before scheduling any tasks on the compute node. If true and the start task fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the start task up to its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task has still not completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service marks the compute node unusable, and will not schedule tasks to it. This condition can be detected via the node state and failure info details. If false, the Batch service will not wait for the start task to complete. In this case, other tasks can start executing on the compute node while the start task is still running; and even if the start task fails, new tasks will continue to be scheduled on the node. The default is false. Specify either 'true' or 'false' to update the property.

Disables the specified job, preventing new tasks from running.  The Batch Service immediately moves the job to the disabling state. Batch then uses the disableTasks parameter to determine what to do with the currently running tasks of the job. The job remains in the disabling state until the disable operation is completed and all tasks have been dealt with according to the disableTasks option; the job then moves to the disabled state. No new tasks are started under the job until it moves back to active state. If you try to disable a job that is in any state other than active, disabling, or disabled, the request fails with status code 409.
A timestamp indicating the last modified time of the resource known to the client. The operation will be performed only if the resource on the service has not been modified since the specified time.

Deletes a deployment from the deployment history.  A template deployment that is currently running cannot be deleted. Deleting a template deployment removes the associated deployment operations. Deleting a template deployment does not affect the state of the resource group. This is an asynchronous operation that returns a status of 202 until the template deployment is successfully deleted. The Location response header contains the URI that is used to obtain the status of the process. While the process is running, a call to the URI in the Location header returns a status of 202. When the process finishes, the URI in the Location header returns a status of 204 on success. If the asynchronous request failed, the URI in the Location header returns an error-level status code.

Deletes a pool from the specified account.  When you request that a pool be deleted, the following actions occur: the pool state is set to deleting; any ongoing resize operation on the pool are stopped; the Batch service starts resizing the pool to zero nodes; any tasks running on existing nodes are terminated and requeued (as if a resize pool operation had been requested with the default requeue option); finally, the pool is removed from the system. Because running tasks are requeued, the user can rerun these tasks by updating their job to target a different pool. The tasks can then run on the new pool. If you want to override the requeue behavior, then you should call resize pool explicitly to shrink the pool to zero size before deleting the pool. If you call an Update, Patch or Delete API on a pool in the deleting state, it will fail with HTTP status code 409 with error code PoolBeingDeleted.

The desired number of dedicated compute nodes in the pool. This property must not be specified if enableAutoScale is set to true. If enableAutoScale is set to false, then you must set either targetDedicatedNodes, targetLowPriorityNodes, or both.
The command line of the start task. The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path (relative to the task working directory), or use the Batch provided environment variable (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
Batch account name. Alternatively, set by environment variable: AZURE_BATCH_ACCOUNT
The SKU of the Batch node agent to be provisioned on compute nodes in the pool. The Batch node agent is a program that runs on each node in the pool, and provides the command-and-control interface between the node and the Batch service. There are different implementations of the node agent, known as SKUs, for different operating systems. You must specify a node agent SKU which matches the selected image reference. To get the list of supported node agent SKUs along with their list of verified image references, see the 'List supported node agent SKUs' operation.
Batch account key. Alternatively, set by environment variable: AZURE_BATCH_ACCESS_KEY
The list of certificates to be installed on each compute node in the pool. For Windows compute nodes, the Batch service installs the certificates to the specified certificate store and location. For Linux compute nodes, the certificates are stored in a directory inside the task working directory and an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to query for this location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs' directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g., /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed in that directory. Space-separated certificate thumbprints.
Whether the Batch service should wait for the start task to complete successfully (that is, to exit with exit code 0) before scheduling any tasks on the compute node. If true and the start task fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the start task up to its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task has still not completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service marks the compute node unusable, and will not schedule tasks to it. This condition can be detected via the node state and failure info details. If false, the Batch service will not wait for the start task to complete. In this case, other tasks can start executing on the compute node while the start task is still running; and even if the start task fails, new tasks will continue to be scheduled on the node. The default is false. True if flag present.
A list of files that the Batch service will download to the compute node before running the command line. Files listed under this element are located in the task's working directory. Space-separated resource references in filename=blobsource format.
The list of application licenses the Batch service will make available on each compute node in the pool. The list of application licenses must be a subset of available Batch service application licenses. If a license is requested which is not supported, pool creation will fail. Space-separated values.
The size of virtual machines in the pool. All virtual machines in a pool are the same size. For information about available sizes of virtual machines for Cloud Services pools (pools created with cloudServiceConfiguration), see Sizes for Cloud Services (https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/cloud-services-sizes-specs/). Batch supports all Cloud Services VM sizes except ExtraSmall, A1V2 and A2V2. For information about available VM sizes for pools using images from the Virtual Machines Marketplace (pools created with virtualMachineConfiguration) see Sizes for Virtual Machines (Linux) (https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-linux-sizes/) or Sizes for Virtual Machines (Windows) (https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-sizes/). Batch supports all Azure VM sizes except STANDARD_A0 and those with premium storage (STANDARD_GS, STANDARD_DS, and STANDARD_DSV2 series).

Retrieves statistics related to replication for the Table service. It is  only available when read-access geo-redundant replication is enabled for  the storage account.  With geo-redundant replication, Azure Storage maintains your data durable  in two locations. In both locations, Azure Storage constantly maintains  multiple healthy replicas of your data. The location where you read,  create, update, or delete data is the primary storage account location.  The primary location exists in the region you choose at the time you  create an account via the Azure Management Azure classic portal, for  example, North Central US. The location to which your data is replicated  is the secondary location. The secondary location is automatically  determined based on the location of the primary; it is in a second data  center that resides in the same region as the primary location. Read-only  access is available from the secondary location, if read-access geo-redundant  replication is enabled for your storage account.

Downloads a file to a file path, with automatic chunking and progress notifications. Returns an instance of File with properties and metadata.
 If set to true, validates an MD5 hash for each retrieved portion of the file. This is primarily valuable for detecting bitflips on the wire if using http instead of https as https (the default) will already validate. Note that the service will only return transactional MD5s for chunks 4MB or less so the first get request will be of size self.MAX_CHUNK_GET_SIZE instead of self.MAX_SINGLE_GET_SIZE. If self.MAX_CHUNK_GET_SIZE was set to greater than 4MB an error will be thrown. As computing the MD5 takes processing time and more requests will need to be done due to the reduced chunk size there may be some increase in latency.
Path of the file to write to. The source filename will be used if not specified.
 End of byte range to use for downloading a section of the file. If end_range is given, start_range must be provided. The start_range and end_range params are inclusive. Ex: start_range=0, end_range=511 will download first 512 bytes of file.
Storage account name. Related environment variable: AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT. Must be used in conjunction with either storage account key or a SAS token. If neither are present, the command will try to query the storage account key using the authenticated Azure account. If a large number of storage commands are executed the API quota may be hit

 A string that represents the snapshot version, if applicable.
A Shared Access Signature (SAS). Must be used in conjunction with storage account name. Environment variable: AZURE_STORAGE_SAS_TOKEN
The file share name.
 Mode to use when opening the file. Note that specifying append only open_mode prevents parallel download. So, max_connections must be set to 1 if this open_mode is used.
Storage account key. Must be used in conjunction with storage account name. Environment variable: AZURE_STORAGE_KEY
 If set to 2 or greater, an initial get will be done for the first self.MAX_SINGLE_GET_SIZE bytes of the file. If this is the entire file, the method returns at this point. If it is not, it will download the remaining data parallel using the number of threads equal to max_connections. Each chunk will be of size self.MAX_CHUNK_GET_SIZE. If set to 1, a single large get request will be done. This is not generally recommended but available if very few threads should be used, network requests are very expensive, or a non-seekable stream prevents parallel download. This may also be valuable if the file is being concurrently modified to enforce atomicity or if many files are expected to be empty as an extra request is required for empty files if max_connections is greater than 1.
 Start of byte range to use for downloading a section of the file. If no end_range is given, all bytes after the start_range will be downloaded. The start_range and end_range params are inclusive. Ex: start_range=0, end_range=511 will download first 512 bytes of file.

Reset the properties of a job schedule.  An updated job specification only applies to new jobs.
The time interval between the start times of two successive jobs under the job schedule. A job schedule can have at most one active job under it at any given time. Because a job schedule can have at most one active job under it at any given time, if it is time to create a new job under a job schedule, but the previous job is still running, the Batch service will not create the new job until the previous job finishes. If the previous job does not finish within the startWindow period of the new recurrenceInterval, then no new job will be scheduled for that interval. For recurring jobs, you should normally specify a jobManagerTask in the jobSpecification. If you do not use jobManagerTask, you will need an external process to monitor when jobs are created, add tasks to the jobs and terminate the jobs ready for the next recurrence. The default is that the schedule does not recur: one job is created, within the startWindow after the doNotRunUntil time, and the schedule is complete as soon as that job finishes. The minimum value is 1 minute. If you specify a lower value, the Batch service rejects the schedule with an error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request). Expected format is an ISO-8601 duration.
A string that uniquely identifies the Job Manager task within the job. The ID can contain any combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot contain more than 64 characters.
A list of files that the Batch service will download to the compute node before running the command line. Files listed under this element are located in the task's working directory. Space-separated resource references in filename=blobsource format.
A list of environment variable settings for the Job Manager task. Space-separated values in 'key=value' format.
Batch service endpoint. Alternatively, set by environment variable: AZURE_BATCH_ENDPOINT
A timestamp indicating the last modified time of the resource known to the client. The operation will be performed only if the resource on the service has not been modified since the specified time.
The priority of jobs created under this schedule. Priority values can range from -1000 to 1000, with -1000 being the lowest priority and 1000 being the highest priority. The default value is 0. This priority is used as the default for all jobs under the job schedule. You can update a job's priority after it has been created using by using the update job API.
A file containing the job schedule update parameter specification in JSON format. If this parameter is specified, all 'Job Schedule Arguments' are ignored.
A list of name-value pairs associated with the job schedule as metadata. If you do not specify this element, it takes the default value of an empty list; in effect, any existing metadata is deleted. Space-separated values in 'key=value' format.
An ETag value associated with the version of the resource known to the client. The operation will be performed only if the resource's current ETag on the service exactly matches the value specified by the client.
The command line of the Job Manager task. The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path (relative to the task working directory), or use the Batch provided environment variable (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
A list of name-value pairs associated with each job created under this schedule as metadata. The Batch service does not assign any meaning to metadata; it is solely for the use of user code. Space-separated values in 'key=value' format.
The action the Batch service should take when all tasks in a job created under this schedule are in the completed state. Note that if a job contains no tasks, then all tasks are considered complete. This option is therefore most commonly used with a Job Manager task; if you want to use automatic job termination without a Job Manager, you should initially set onAllTasksComplete to noaction and update the job properties to set onAllTasksComplete to terminatejob once you have finished adding tasks. The default is noaction.
Batch account name. Alternatively, set by environment variable: AZURE_BATCH_ACCOUNT
Batch account key. Alternatively, set by environment variable: AZURE_BATCH_ACCESS_KEY
An ETag value associated with the version of the resource known to the client. The operation will be performed only if the resource's current ETag on the service does not match the value specified by the client.
The ID of the job schedule to update.
A list of application packages that the Batch service will deploy to the compute node before running the command line. Application packages are downloaded and deployed to a shared directory, not the task working directory. Therefore, if a referenced package is already on the compute node, and is up to date, then it is not re-downloaded; the existing copy on the compute node is used. If a referenced application package cannot be installed, for example because the package has been deleted or because download failed, the task fails. Space-separated application IDs with optional version in 'id[#version]' format.
A timestamp indicating the last modified time of the resource known to the client. The operation will be performed only if the resource on the service has been modified since the specified time.
Whether tasks in the job can define dependencies on each other. The default is false. True if flag present.
The earliest time at which any job may be created under this job schedule. If you do not specify a doNotRunUntil time, the schedule becomes ready to create jobs immediately. Expected format is an ISO-8601 timestamp.
The id of an existing pool. All the tasks of the job will run on the specified pool.
The time interval, starting from the time at which the schedule indicates a job should be created, within which a job must be created. If a job is not created within the startWindow interval, then the 'opportunity' is lost; no job will be created until the next recurrence of the schedule. If the schedule is recurring, and the startWindow is longer than the recurrence interval, then this is equivalent to an infinite startWindow, because the job that is 'due' in one recurrenceInterval is not carried forward into the next recurrence interval. The default is infinite. The minimum value is 1 minute. If you specify a lower value, the Batch service rejects the schedule with an error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request). Expected format is an ISO-8601 duration.
A time after which no job will be created under this job schedule. The schedule will move to the completed state as soon as this deadline is past and there is no active job under this job schedule. If you do not specify a doNotRunAfter time, and you are creating a recurring job schedule, the job schedule will remain active until you explicitly terminate it. Expected format is an ISO-8601 timestamp.

Enables the specified job, allowing new tasks to run.  When you call this API, the Batch service sets a disabled job to the enabling state. After the this operation is completed, the job moves to the active state, and scheduling of new tasks under the job resumes.

Update the properties of a Batch job. Updating a property in a subgroup will reset the unspecified properties of that group.
The maximum elapsed time that the job may run, measured from the time the job is created. If the job does not complete within the time limit, the Batch service terminates it and any tasks that are still running. In this case, the termination reason will be MaxWallClockTimeExpiry. If this property is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the job may run. Expected format is an ISO-8601 duration.
The ID of the job whose properties you want to update.
A timestamp indicating the last modified time of the resource known to the client. The operation will be performed only if the resource on the service has not been modified since the specified time.
The action the Batch service should take when all tasks in the job are in the completed state. If omitted, the completion behavior is left unchanged. You may not change the value from terminatejob to noaction - that is, once you have engaged automatic job termination, you cannot turn it off again. If you try to do this, the request fails with an 'invalid property value' error response; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request).
Batch account name. Alternatively, set by environment variable: AZURE_BATCH_ACCOUNT
The priority of the job. Priority values can range from -1000 to 1000, with -1000 being the lowest priority and 1000 being the highest priority. If omitted, the priority of the job is left unchanged.
A timestamp indicating the last modified time of the resource known to the client. The operation will be performed only if the resource on the service has been modified since the specified time.
A file containing the job patch parameter specification in JSON format. If this parameter is specified, all 'Job Arguments' are ignored.
The maximum number of times each task may be retried. The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try each task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries a task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry tasks. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries tasks without limit. The default value is 0 (no retries).
A list of name-value pairs associated with the job as metadata. If omitted, the existing job metadata is left unchanged. Space-separated values in 'key=value' format.
Batch service endpoint. Alternatively, set by environment variable: AZURE_BATCH_ENDPOINT
An ETag value associated with the version of the resource known to the client. The operation will be performed only if the resource's current ETag on the service does not match the value specified by the client.
The id of an existing pool. All the tasks of the job will run on the specified pool.
Batch account key. Alternatively, set by environment variable: AZURE_BATCH_ACCESS_KEY
An ETag value associated with the version of the resource known to the client. The operation will be performed only if the resource's current ETag on the service exactly matches the value specified by the client.

Updates the visibility timeout of a message. You can also use this operation to update the contents of a message.  This operation can be used to continually extend the invisibility of a  queue message. This functionality can be useful if you want a worker role  to "lease" a queue message. For example, if a worker role calls get_messages  and recognizes that it needs more time to process a message, it can  continually extend the message's invisibility until it is processed. If  the worker role were to fail during processing, eventually the message  would become visible again and another worker role could process it.  If the key-encryption-key field is set on the local service object, this method will encrypt the content before uploading.

Downloads a blob to a file path, with automatic chunking and progress notifications. Returns an instance of :class:`~azure.storage.blob.models.Blob` with properties and metadata.
 If set to true, validates an MD5 hash for each retrieved portion of the blob. This is primarily valuable for detecting bitflips on the wire if using http instead of https as https (the default) will already validate. Note that the service will only return transactional MD5s for chunks 4MB or less so the first get request will be of size self.MAX_CHUNK_GET_SIZE instead of self.MAX_SINGLE_GET_SIZE. If self.MAX_CHUNK_GET_SIZE was set to greater than 4MB an error will be thrown. As computing the MD5 takes processing time and more requests will need to be done due to the reduced chunk size there may be some increase in latency.
 If set to 2 or greater, an initial get will be done for the first self.MAX_SINGLE_GET_SIZE bytes of the blob. If this is the entire blob, the method returns at this point. If it is not, it will download the remaining data parallel using the number of threads equal to max_connections. Each chunk will be of size self.MAX_CHUNK_GET_SIZE. If set to 1, a single large get request will be done. This is not generally recommended but available if very few threads should be used, network requests are very expensive, or a non-seekable stream prevents parallel download. This may also be useful if many blobs are expected to be empty as an extra request is required for empty blobs if max_connections is greater than 1.
A Shared Access Signature (SAS). Must be used in conjunction with storage account name. Environment variable: AZURE_STORAGE_SAS_TOKEN
 Required if the blob has an active lease.

Storage account connection string. Environment variable: AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING
Request timeout in seconds. Applies to each call to the service.
Storage account name. Related environment variable: AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT. Must be used in conjunction with either storage account key or a SAS token.

Include this flag to disable progress reporting for the command.
 Path of file to write out to.
 An ETag value, or the wildcard character (*). Specify this header to perform the operation only if the resource's ETag does not match the value specified. Specify the wildcard character (*) to perform the operation only if the resource does not exist, and fail the operation if it does exist.
 End of byte range to use for downloading a section of the blob. If end_range is given, start_range must be provided. The start_range and end_range params are inclusive. Ex: start_range=0, end_range=511 will download first 512 bytes of blob.
Alter only if modified since supplied UTC datetime (Y-m-d'T'H:M'Z')
The container name.
 Mode to use when opening the file. Note that specifying append only open_mode prevents parallel download. So, max_connections must be set to 1 if this open_mode is used.
